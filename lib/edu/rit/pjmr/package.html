<BODY>

Package edu.rit.pjmr contains
Parallel Java Map Reduce (PJMR),
a simple parallel map-reduce framework
built on top of Parallel Java 2.
PJMR uses Parallel Java 2's capabilities
to run map-reduce computations
on multicore parallel computers,
cluster parallel computers,
and hybrid multicore cluster parallel computers.

<P>
Refer to class <A HREF="PjmrJob.html">PjmrJob</A>
for documentation on programming PJMR map-reduce jobs.

<P>
PJMR is inspired by Apache's Hadoop,
but is considerably simpler.
PJMR omits most of Hadoop's advanced features,
such as fault tolerance,
speculative execution,
and the Hadoop Distributed File System.
