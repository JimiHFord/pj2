/**
 * Class Task is the abstract base class for a PJ2 task. A PJ2 parallel program
 * is either a single task (a subclass of class Task) or is a number of tasks
 * grouped together into a job (a subclass of class {@linkplain Job Job}). A PJ2
 * program is executed by running the PJ2 launcher program, class {@link pj2
 * pj2}.
 * <P>
 * <B>Programming a task.</B>
 * To set up a task:
 * <UL>
 * <P><LI>
 * Write a subclass of class Task.
 * <P><LI>
 * Optionally, specify the task's initial properties by overriding the {@link
 * #initialThreads() initialThreads()}, {@link #initialSchedule()
 * initialSchedule()}, and/or {@link #initialChunk() initialChunk()} methods.
 * <P><LI>
 * Optionally, specify the node capabilities required to execute the task by
 * overriding the {@link #nodeNameRequired() nodeNameRequired()}, {@link
 * #coresRequired() coresRequired()}, and/or {@link #gpusRequired()
 * gpusRequired()} methods.
 * <P><LI>
 * In the Task subclass's {@link #main(String[]) main()} method, write the code
 * for the task's computation.
 * </UL>
 * <P>
 * The task's computation can contain sequential statements executed by a single
 * thread, interspersed with parallel statements executed by multiple threads in
 * parallel. The possible parallel statements are:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>
 * Work sharing parallel for loop, integer loop index (see {@link
 * #parallelFor(int,int) parallelFor(int,int)})
 * <LI>
 * Work sharing parallel for loop, long integer loop index (see {@link
 * #parallelFor(long,long) parallelFor(long,long)})
 * <LI>
 * Work sharing parallel for loop over the elements returned by an iterator (see
 * {@link #parallelFor(Iterator) parallelFor(Iterator)})
 * <LI>
 * Work sharing parallel for loop over the elements in an iterable collection
 * (see {@link #parallelFor(Iterable) parallelFor(Iterable)})
 * <LI>
 * Parallel section group, multiple different sections (see {@link
 * #parallelDo(Section[]) parallelDo(Section...)})
 * <LI>
 * Parallel section group, multiple copies of the same section (see {@link
 * #parallelDo(int,Section) parallelDo(int,Section)})
 * <LI>
 * Worker portion of a master-worker cluster parallel for loop (see {@link
 * #workerFor() workerFor()})
 * </UL>
 * <P>
 * The task's computation can query the task's properties by calling the {@link
 * #threads() threads()}, {@link #schedule() schedule()}, {@link #chunk()
 * chunk()}, {@link #nodeName() nodeName()}, {@link #cores() cores()}, and
 * {@link #gpus() gpus()} methods. The task's computation can alter the task's
 * initial properties by calling the {@link #threads(int) threads(int)}, {@link
 * #schedule(Schedule) schedule(Schedule)}, and {@link #chunk(int) chunk(int)}
 * methods. While the task's computation can alter the task's <TT>nodeName</TT>,
 * <TT>cores</TT>, and <TT>gpus</TT> properties, doing so has no effect once the
 * task has started.
 * <P>
 * Shared variables used by the thread executing the sequential statements and
 * by the threads executing the parallel statements are typically declared as
 * fields of the Task subclass. This puts the shared variables in scope both for
 * code in the {@link #main(String[]) main()} method and for code in the
 * parallel statements.
 * <P>
 * <B>Running a task.</B>
 * To run a task, type this command:
 * <P>
 * <TT>$ java pj2 MainTask <I>arg</I> ...</TT>
 * <P>
 * The above command runs class MainTask, a subclass of class Task. Replace
 * <TT>MainTask</TT> with the fully-qualified class name of the desired task
 * subclass. The {@link pj2 pj2} program creates an instance of the task
 * subclass, then calls the task's {@link #main(String[]) main()} method,
 * passing in an array of the command line argument strings (zero or more). The
 * {@link #main(String[]) main()} method carries out the computation.
 * <P>
 * <B>Tasks in a job.</B>
 * A PJ2 task may be executed as part of a {@linkplain Job Job}. The job
 * maintains a repository of {@linkplain Tuple Tuple}s known as <I>tuple
 * space.</I> The job's execution is driven by <I>firing</I> the job's
 * {@linkplain Rule Rule}s, based on tuples that are written into tuple space.
 * Each rule has an associated <I>task group</I> consisting of one or more
 * tasks. There are three kinds of rules:
 * <UL>
 * <P><LI>
 * <I>Start rule</I>&mdash;A rule that fires once when the job starts.
 * <P><LI>
 * <I>On-demand rule</I>&mdash;A rule that fires when a certain tuple or tuples
 * are present in tuple space.
 * <P><LI>
 * <I>Finish rule</I>&mdash;A rule that fires once when the job finishes.
 * </UL>
 * <P>
 * When a rule fires, for each task in the rule's task group, an instance of the
 * task is constructed, and the task's {@link Task#main(String[]) main()} method
 * is called to carry out the task's computation. For further information about
 * the criteria for firing rules and the actions performed when firing rules,
 * see class {@linkplain Rule Rule}.
 * <P>
 * The task can determine the number of tasks in its task group by calling the
 * {@link #groupSize() groupSize()} method. The task can determine its own rank
 * in its task group by calling the {@link #taskRank() taskRank()} method. The
 * tasks in a rule's task group are assigned successive ranks, starting with 0,
 * in the order the tasks were added to the rule. The task's rank uniquely
 * distinguishes the task from all other tasks in the task group.
 * <P>
 * The task may get <I>input tuples</I> in several ways. The task may take
 * tuples out of tuple space by calling the {@link #takeTuple(Tuple)
 * takeTuple()} or {@link #tryToTakeTuple(Tuple) tryToTakeTuple()} methods,
 * specifying a template for matching the desired tuple. The task may read
 * tuples, without taking them out of tuple space, by calling the {@link
 * #readTuple(Tuple) readTuple()} or {@link #tryToReadTuple(Tuple)
 * tryToReadTuple()} methods, specifying a template for matching the desired
 * tuple. A task launched by an on-demand rule may also obtain one of the rule's
 * matching tuples by calling the {@link #getMatchingTuple(int)
 * getMatchingTuple()} method.
 * <P>
 * The task may put <I>output tuples</I> into tuple space by calling the {@link
 * #putTuple(Tuple) putTuple()} method. Such tuples may trigger further rules to
 * fire and further tasks to be executed. The task may also specify that
 * multiple copies of a tuple are to be put into tuple space.
 * <P>
 * The task <I>must not alter its input tuples.</I> If an output tuple needs to
 * be the same as an input tuple but with modifications, create a copy of the
 * input tuple and modify that.
 * <P>
 * <B>I/O in a task.</B>
 * If a task is not running as part of a {@linkplain Job Job}, code in the task
 * can print on <TT>System.out</TT> or <TT>System.err</TT>, and the printouts
 * appear on the task's process's console as usual. The printouts actually
 * appear on the console when the task terminates; to make the printouts appear
 * earlier, call <TT>System.out.flush()</TT> or <TT>System.err.flush()</TT>.
 * Code in such a task can also read and write files as usual.
 * <P>
 * If a task is launched by a {@linkplain Job Job}, code in the task can print
 * on <TT>System.out</TT> or <TT>System.err</TT>, and the printouts are
 * automatically redirected to the job's process's console. The printouts
 * actually appear on the console when the task terminates; to make the
 * printouts appear earlier, call <TT>System.out.flush()</TT> or
 * <TT>System.err.flush()</TT>.
 * <P>
 * For other I/O, such as reading from the job's standard input, reading files,
 * and writing files, the task might need to run in the job's process. This
 * would be necessary, for example, if tasks running on separate nodes do not
 * run in the user's account and so cannot access the user's files. For further
 * information, see class {@linkplain Job Job}.
 * <P>
 * <B>JVM heap size in a task.</B>
 * If a task is not running as part of a {@linkplain Job Job}, you can specify
 * the maximum JVM heap size with a flag on the <TT>java</TT> command. For
 * example, to get a 2-gigabyte heap, type this command:
 * <P>
 * <TT>java -Xmx2000m pj2 MainTask <I>arg</I> ...</TT>
 * <P>
 * If a task is launched by a {@linkplain Job Job}, you can specify the maximum
 * JVM heap size by calling the {@link TaskSpec#jvmFlags(String[]) jvmFlags()}
 * method in the {@linkplain TaskSpec TaskSpec} in the {@linkplain Rule Rule}
 * that launches the task. For further information, see class {@linkplain Job
 * Job}.
 * <P>
 * <B>Abnormal termination.</B>
 * If code in a task throws an exception that propagates out of the
 * <TT>main()</TT> method, the {@link pj2 pj2} program prints an exception stack
 * trace and terminates.
 * <P>
 * Code in a task must <I>not</I> call the <TT>System.exit()</TT> method. If a
 * task needs to terminate itself, the task should throw an exception that
 * propagates out of every method without being caught, such as a {@linkplain
 * edu.rit.pj2.TerminateException TerminateException} or any other runtime
 * exception. The exception's detail message can explain why the task
 * terminated. This exception propagates out of the <TT>main()</TT> method and
 * causes the <TT>pj2</TT> program to terminate.
