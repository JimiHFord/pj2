/**
 * Class Section is the abstract base class for a section of code executed in
 * parallel with other sections.
 * <P>
 * <B>Programming pattern.</B>
 * To execute a group of different parallel sections in the {@link
 * Task#main(String[]) main()} method of a {@linkplain Task}, follow this
 * pattern:
 * <PRE>
 * public class MyTask extends Task
 *     {
 *     public void main (String[] args)
 *         {
 *         parallelDo (new Section()
 *             {
 *             public void run()
 *                 {
 *                 // <I>Code for first section</I>
 *                 }
 *             },
 *         new Section()
 *             {
 *             public void run()
 *                 {
 *                 // <I>Code for second section</I>
 *                 }
 *             });
 *         }
 *     }</PRE>
 * <P>
 * There can be any number of sections in the {@link Task#parallelDo(Section[])
 * parallelDo()} method call. There must be at least one section.
 * <P>
 * To execute a number of copies of the same parallel section in the {@link
 * Task#main(String[]) main()} method of a {@linkplain Task}, follow this
 * pattern:
 * <PRE>
 * public class MyTask extends Task
 *     {
 *     public void main (String[] args)
 *         {
 *         parallelDo (3, new Section()
 *             {
 *             public void run()
 *                 {
 *                 // <I>Code for section</I>
 *                 }
 *             });
 *         }
 *     }</PRE>
 * <P>
 * In the above example, three copies of the section are executed in parallel.
 * <P>
 * <B>Parallel thread team.</B>
 * The parallel section group is executed by a team of threads. There are as
 * many threads as there are sections. Each thread calls the {@link #run()
 * run()} method on a different Section object.
 * <P>
 * <B>End-of-sections barrier.</B>
 * There is an implicit barrier at the end of the parallel section group. After
 * returning from the {@link #run() run()} method, each team thread arrives at
 * the barrier. Once every team thread has arrived at the barrier, the {@link
 * Task#parallelDo(Section[]) parallelDo()} method returns.
 * <P>
 * <B>Reduction.</B>
 * To execute a parallel section group with reduction, follow this pattern:
 * <PRE>
 * public class MyTask extends Task
 *     {
 *     IntVbl counter = new IntVbl.Sum();
 *
 *     public void main (String[] args)
 *         {
 *         parallelDo (new Section()
 *             {
 *             public void run()
 *                 {
 *                 IntVbl thrCounter = threadLocal (counter);
 *                 thrCounter.item = 42; // or whatever
 *                 }
 *             },
 *         new Section()
 *             {
 *             public void run()
 *                 {
 *                 IntVbl thrCounter = threadLocal (counter);
 *                 thrCounter.item = 24; // or whatever
 *                 }
 *             });
 *         System.out.printf ("Counter = %d%n", counter.item);
 *         }
 *     }</PRE>
 * <P>
 * In this example, <TT>counter</TT> is declared as a field of the {@link Task}
 * subclass, and so is a global shared variable. It is an instance of class
 * {@link edu.rit.pj2.vbl.IntVbl.Sum IntVbl.Sum}. The <TT>counter</TT>'s {@link
 * edu.rit.pj2.vbl.IntVbl#item item} field is an integer. The counter's {@link
 * edu.rit.pj2.vbl.IntVbl.Sum#reduce(Vbl) reduce()} method adds the
 * <TT>item</TT> fields together.
 * <P>
 * Each thread, upon calling its section's {@link #run() run()} method, calls
 * the {@link #threadLocal(Vbl) threadLocal()} method, passing in the global
 * counter. This returns a thread-local copy of the global counter, which
 * becomes the thread's own <TT>thrCounter</TT>. Each thread sets its own
 * <TT>thrCounter</TT>'s item to a certain value. Note that no synchronization
 * is required, as each thread is updating its own <TT>thrCounter</TT>.
 * <P>
 * When the parallel section group finishes executing, all the threads' local
 * variables are automatically reduced together in a multiple thread safe
 * fashion. The reduction is performed by the {@link
 * edu.rit.pj2.vbl.IntVbl.Sum#reduce(Vbl) reduce()} method, so all the threads'
 * local counters' {@link edu.rit.pj2.vbl.IntVbl#item item} fields are added
 * together. The result (66 in this example) is stored back in the global
 * variable's {@link edu.rit.pj2.vbl.IntVbl#item item} field, which is then
 * printed.
