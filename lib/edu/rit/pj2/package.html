Package edu.rit.pj2 contains Parallel Java 2 (PJ2),
an API and middleware for parallel programming in 100% Java
on multicore parallel computers,
cluster parallel computers,
supercomputing grids,
and cloud computing services.

<P>
PJ2 is designed for writing two kinds of parallel programs:
tightly coupled single-node
and loosely coupled multi-node.

<P>
<H3>Tightly Coupled Single-Node Parallel Programs</H3>

<P>
A tightly coupled single-node parallel program
is intended to run on one multicore node.
The program consists of multiple threads
that run in parallel on separate cores.
The threads communicate and coordinate
by reading and writing variables in shared memory.

<P>
This kind of PJ2 program is expressed
as a subclass of class <A HREF="Task.html">Task</A>.
The program is executed
by running the <A HREF="../../../pj2.html"><TT>pj2</TT></A>
launcher program as follows:
<P>
<TT>$ java pj2 MainTask <I>arg</I> ...</TT>
<P>
The above command creates an instance of class MainTask,
a subclass of class <A HREF="Task.html">Task</A>.
Replace <TT>MainTask</TT> with the fully-qualified class name
of the desired task subclass.
The launcher creates an instance of the task subclass,
then calls that task's
<A HREF="Task.html#main(java.lang.String[])"><TT>main()</TT></A>
method,
passing in an array of the command line argument strings
(zero or more).
The task executes in the launcher's process.
The
<A HREF="Task.html#main(java.lang.String[])"><TT>main()</TT></A>
method carries out the computation.
When the
<A HREF="Task.html#main(java.lang.String[])"><TT>main()</TT></A>
method returns, the launcher terminates.

<P>
The computation can contain sequential statements
executed by a single thread,
interspersed with parallel statements
executed by multiple threads.
Running on a multicore computer,
the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
schedules each thread on a separate core,
thus executing the program in parallel.

<P>
<H3>Loosely Coupled Multi-Node Parallel Programs</H3>

<P>
A loosely coupled multi-node parallel program
is intended to run on multiple nodes.
The nodes may be located in a cluster parallel computer,
in a grid,
or in a cloud.
The program consists of multiple <A HREF="Task.html">Task</A>s
that run in parallel on separate nodes.
The tasks coordinate and communicate with each other
by reading and writing <A HREF="Tuple.html">Tuple</A>s
in <I>tuple space.</I>
The tasks are intended to be <I>coarse-grained,</I>
meaning each task runs for minutes or hours, not milliseconds.
The tasks are intended to communicate
<I>small to medium amounts of data</I> via tuple space,
not enormous quantities of data.

<P>
This kind of PJ2 program is expressed
as a subclass of class <A HREF="Job.html">Job</A>.
The program is executed
by running the <A HREF="../../../pj2.html"><TT>pj2</TT></A>
launcher program as follows:
<P>
<TT>$ java pj2 jar=<I>file</I> MainJob <I>arg</I> ...</TT>
<P>
The above command creates an instance of class MainJob,
a subclass of class <A HREF="Job.html">Job</A>.
Replace <TT>MainJob</TT> with the fully-qualified class name
of the desired job subclass.
The launcher creates an instance of the job subclass,
then calls that job's
<A HREF="Job#main(java.lang.String[])"<TT>main()</TT></A>
method,
passing in an array
of the command line argument strings (zero or more).
The
<A HREF="Job#main(java.lang.String[])"<TT>main()</TT></A>
method defines <A HREF="Rule.html">Rule</A>s
that specify which <A HREF="Task.html">Task</A>s
are to be executed as part of the job.
The launcher creates and executes those tasks,
which carry out the job's computation.
The tasks may execute in the launcher's process
or on computational nodes that are part of
a cluster, grid, or cloud.
When all the tasks have finished executing,
the launcher terminates.

<P>
Running on a cluster, grid, or cloud,
the program executes each task on a separate node,
thus executing the program in parallel.
Each task receives input tuples
that are taken out of tuple space,
performs computations,
and generates output tuples
that are written into tuple space.
Each task executes independently of other tasks.
All inter-task coordination and communication
goes through tuple space.
