/**
 * Class DoubleHistogramVbl is the abstract base class for a histogram that
 * categorizes values of type <TT>double</TT> into bins and counts the number of
 * occurrences in each bin. The {@link #bin(double) bin()} method determines the
 * bin for a given value; this method must be overridden in a subclass.
 * <P>
 * Class DoubleHistogramVbl supports doing a chi-square test on the bin counts.
 * See the {@link #chisqr() chisqr()}, {@link #pvalue(double) pvalue()}, and
 * {@link #expectedCount(int) expectedCount()} methods.
 * <P>
 * Class DoubleHistogramVbl supports the <I>parallel reduction</I> pattern. Each
 * thread creates a thread-local copy of the shared variable by calling the
 * {@link edu.rit.pj2.Loop#threadLocal(Vbl) threadLocal()} method of class
 * {@linkplain edu.rit.pj2.Loop Loop} or the {@link
 * edu.rit.pj2.Section#threadLocal(Vbl) threadLocal()} method of class
 * {@linkplain edu.rit.pj2.Section Section}. Each thread performs operations on
 * its own copy, without needing to synchronize with the other threads. At the
 * end of the parallel statement, the thread-local copies are automatically
 * <I>reduced</I> together, and the result is stored in the original shared
 * variable. The reduction is performed by the shared variable's {@link
 * #reduce(Vbl) reduce()} method.
